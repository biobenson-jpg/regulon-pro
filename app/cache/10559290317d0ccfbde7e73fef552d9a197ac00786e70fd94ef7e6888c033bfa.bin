Involved in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) differentiation: preferentially binds mRNAs that are not methylated by N6-methyladenosine (m6A), stabilizing them, promoting ESCs differentiation (By similarity). Binds to poly-U elements and AU-rich elements (AREs) in the 3'-UTR of target mRNAs. Binds avidly to the AU-rich element in FOS and IL3/interleukin-3 mRNAs. In the case of the FOS AU-rich element, binds to a core element of 27 nucleotides that contain AUUUA, AUUUUA, and AUUUUU [...] "}]
