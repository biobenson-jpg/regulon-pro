Component of the microprocessor complex that is required to process primary miRNA transcripts (pri-miRNAs) to release precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA) in the nucleus. Within the microprocessor complex, DROSHA cleaves the 3' and 5' strands of a stem-loop in pri- miRNAs (processing center 11 bp from the dsRNA-ssRNA junction) to release hairpin-shaped pre-miRNAs that are subsequently cut by the cytoplasmic DICER to generate mature miRNAs.
