C0	52	Cell cycle / mitosis	CDK2, CDKN1A, CCNA2, AURKA, CDKN1B, GADD45A		Module C0 (n=52) delineates a program of cell-cycle progression and mitotic control, with high-degree hubs including CDK2, CDKN1A, CCNA2, AURKA, CDKN1B, GADD45A. Enrichment was not available; nevertheless, hub composition is consistent with cell-cycle progression and mitotic control.
C1	51	Chromatin / transcription regulation	JUN, CREBBP, MAPK9, STAT3, MAPK8, EP300		Module C1 (n=51) delineates a program of chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation, with high-degree hubs including JUN, CREBBP, MAPK9, STAT3, MAPK8, EP300. Enrichment was not available; nevertheless, hub composition is consistent with chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation.
C2	51	DNA damage / repair	BRCA1, BRCA2, BARD1, RAD51, ATM, CHEK2		Module C2 (n=51) delineates a program of DNA damage signaling and repair, with high-degree hubs including BRCA1, BRCA2, BARD1, RAD51, ATM, CHEK2. Enrichment was not available; nevertheless, hub composition is consistent with DNA damage signaling and repair.
